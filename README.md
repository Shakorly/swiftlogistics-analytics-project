## Phase 1: Strategy & Initiation

### 1.1 Problem Statement & Opportunity Analysis

**The Business Problem:**
SwiftLogistics Inc. is a third-party logistics (3PL) provider whose core value proposition is a 48-hour delivery Service Level Agreement (SLA). The company is currently failing to meet this SLA on approximately 30% of its packages, resulting in direct financial penalties, customer churn, and escalating operational costs (especially fuel). The root cause is a lack of data visibility; the existing fragmented tracking systems do not allow for a holistic analysis of the delivery lifecycle, making it impossible to identify the root causes of delays or measure operational efficiency.

**The Opportunity:**
By centralizing and analyzing its operational data, SwiftLogistics has the opportunity to:
- **Increase Profitability:** By identifying and resolving the root causes of delays, the company can avoid SLA penalties and reduce customer churn.
- **Reduce Operational Costs:** By analyzing route performance and fuel consumption, the company can optimize delivery routes, leading to significant fuel savings and reduced driver overtime.
- **Improve Service Quality:** By creating a data-driven performance culture, the company can consistently meet its 48-hour SLA, strengthening its brand reputation and competitive advantage.

This project will build the foundational data platform required to seize these opportunities.
