### 1. Introduction & Project Background

This document outlines the business, functional, and non-functional requirements for the SwiftLogistics Performance Analytics System. The project's primary goal is to address critical failures in meeting the company's 48-hour Service Level Agreement (SLA) by replacing fragmented, manual data analysis with a centralized, automated business intelligence platform. The solution will provide actionable insights to reduce operational costs, improve delivery performance, and enhance strategic decision-making.

The full project background and justification are detailed in the **Project Charter**.

### 2. Business Objectives

The key business objectives for this project are:
- To improve the On-Time Delivery (OTD) rate from 70% to >95%.
- To reduce the average fuel cost per delivery by 15%.
- To provide daily, automated performance reports to management.

### 3. Scope

The scope for this project is strictly defined in the **Project Charter**. The system will focus exclusively on the analysis of the package lifecycle from Distribution Center (DC) receipt to final customer delivery.

---

### 4. Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders for this project are the Chief Operations Officer (COO), the Logistics Manager, and the Finance Director. Their specific data needs are the foundation for the functional requirements detailed below.

### 5. Functional Requirements

The system must provide the following analytical capabilities, mapped to the requirements gathered in the **Opportunity Stakeholder Matrix**:

| Req No | Functional Requirement | User Story |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REQ-001** | **SLA Performance Tracking:** The system must calculate and display the overall On-Time Delivery (OTD) percentage. Users must be able to filter this metric by Date, Distribution Center, and Route. | "As a COO, I want to see our overall OTD rate so that I can report on our core business promise to our partners and the board." |
| **REQ-002** | **Lifecycle Stage Analysis:** The system must measure and display the average time a package spends in each processing stage (`Processing`, `In-Transit`, `Out for Delivery`). | "As a Logistics Manager, I want to see the duration of each delivery stage so that I can identify the specific bottlenecks causing our delays." |
| **REQ-003** | **Route Performance Analysis:** The system must rank delivery routes by their OTD percentage and average delivery time. | "As a Logistics Manager, I want to identify our best and worst performing routes so that I can optimize route planning." |
| **REQ-004** | **Driver Performance Metrics:** The system must calculate key metrics for each driver, including `Total Deliveries`, `OTD %`, and `Average Deliveries per Day`. | "As a Logistics Manager, I want to see performance data for each driver so that I can conduct fair, data-driven performance reviews." |
| **REQ-005** | **Cost Efficiency Analysis:** The system must calculate and display the average fuel cost per package delivered, filterable by Date, Distribution Center, and Route. | "As a Finance Director, I want to track our cost-efficiency so that I can manage our operational budget and improve profitability." |

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

| NFR ID | Category | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NFR-01** | **Data Freshness** | The data in the analytical dashboard must be refreshed daily and reflect all transactions from the previous business day. |
| **NFR-02** | **Performance** | Dashboard reports must load and respond to user filters within 5 seconds for a standard date range (e.g., 30 days). |
| **NFR-03** | **Security** | Access to the dashboard will be role-based. The Finance Director may have access to cost data that is restricted for other users. |
| **NFR-04** | **Data Retention** | The data warehouse must store a rolling 3 years of historical data for trend analysis. |
